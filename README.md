# Modifications-in-General-Relativity

The following differential equations were solved using the `neurodiffeq` package experimented with different boundary and initial conditions.

- Schwarzschild Equations
  - formulated in form of a single-variable equation
  - equated as a bernaulli equation
- Stelle Gravity Equation
- Infinitely degenerate Ricci-flat solutions
